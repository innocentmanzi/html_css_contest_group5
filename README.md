Introduction and Project Overview
Our team's goal when developing ExploreHub's website was to build a concierge website that would serve the needs of Rwandans, expats, and visitors looking for a variety of services. Travel and entertainment were the two main areas of emphasis. The project's goals were to create a platform that is easy to use, demonstrate the technical expertise we had gained, and guarantee a responsive and interesting user experience.
Our objectives at ExploreHub were to offer a comprehensive platform with a wide range of services to help residents, foreigners, and visitors identify and access different resources in Rwanda.
